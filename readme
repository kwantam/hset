(23:25:10) cecefoo: it would be cool if there was some sort of tally of how many right vs. wrong, and a timer... ? :)
(23:25:21) scrap1r0n: goooooood goooooooood
(23:25:23) scrap1r0n: thanks for the suggestions
(23:25:31) cecefoo: hehe
(23:25:40) cecefoo: you know, for the truly cutthroat set player
(23:25:47) scrap1r0n: nono that's why I asked you
(23:25:55) scrap1r0n: you're the most cutthroat player I know
(23:25:59) cecefoo: hehe :0
(23:26:41) cecefoo: make sure it doesn't deduct from the percentage correct when you submit no checked boxes, if that is indeed correct
(23:28:16) scrap1r0n: ahhh but if you ask and you're wrong, it should deduct I suppose
(23:28:31) cecefoo: yes
(23:28:34) cecefoo: definitely
(23:28:34) cecefoo: maybe 2 points
(23:28:47) scrap1r0n: twice as much as getting one wronG?
(23:29:03) cecefoo: eh, maybe not
(23:29:24) cecefoo: there should be a scoreboard where you can enter your name :)
